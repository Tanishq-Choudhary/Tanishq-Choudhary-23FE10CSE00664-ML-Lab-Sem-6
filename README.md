# ML-Lab-Sem-6-Tanishq-Choudhary-23FE10CSE00664

This repository contains the complete set of experiments work completed as part of the Machine Learning Lab in Semester 6.  Student Details Name: Tanishq Choudhary Semester: 6 Reg No: 23FE10CSE00664. Assigned dataset is chronic kidney disease.

The following two labs were done before assigned dataset:

Lab 1 : This experiment loads the US Housing dataset from Kaggle using Pandas, explores its structure using head(), dtypes, info(), and describe(), and visualizes relationships between features using histograms, pairplots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis. Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Lab 2: This experiment demonstrates data preprocessing on the USA Housing dataset, including dataset inspection, handling categorical data, feature-target separation, standardization using StandardScaler, and visualization to highlight the importance of feature scaling.

The following labs were done with assigned dataset of chronic kidney disease:

Lab 1 : Implement Python programming constructs and libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for basic data analysis tasks. (array, zeros, ones,shape, reshape, read_csv, dataframe, head, tail, info, describe, dtypes) 

Lab 2 : Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to prepare datasets for machine learning tasks. (isnull, not null, dropna, fillna,astype, rename, replace,) (plot, line, bar, scatter, histogram, boxplot)

Lab 3 : Apply descriptive statistical techniques to summarize and interpret datasets. 

Lab 4 : This experiment loads the assigned CKD dataset and applies feature scaling, encoding, and feature selection techniques to improve model performance.

Lab 5 : To preprocess and analyze the CKD dataset, build and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier for CKD detection, and apply Logistic Regression to the USA Housing dataset to demonstrate why it is unsuitable for regression problems.
